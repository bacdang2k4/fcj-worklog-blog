# Goal-Oriented Growth: Driving AWS Marketplace Success with COSS

Cloud marketplaces have evolved into a powerful channel for technology companies to reach customers. According to Canalys projections, by 2028, enterprise software sales via cloud marketplaces will reach **$85 billion USD**, with many organizations now using **AWS Marketplace** as their preferred procurement channel for software, data, and professional services. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

To help partners succeed, AWS introduces the **COSS (Characteristics of Successful Sellers)** framework, comprising six pillars that embody strategic, business, and technical best practices. AWS research shows that partners who adopt the COSS framework tend to grow **31% faster** in Marketplace sales compared to peers. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## AWS Partner Commitment to Marketplace Revenue

A foundational pillar of the COSS framework is ensuring **leadership commitment** to AWS Marketplace revenue. Success starts at the top—executives must set explicit goals, signal priority, and align the entire organization around Marketplace growth. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

Why this focus matters:

- **Organizational Alignment**: Revenue goals help unify product, sales, marketing, and operations toward the same objectives. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Resource Prioritization**: When Marketplace revenue is an explicit target, teams are more willing to allocate budgets, headcount, and technical resources to support it. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Accountability & Measurement**: Clear goals transform Marketplace from a side channel into a core, measurable business initiative with defined ownership and metrics. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Setting Goals Across Teams

To turn top-level ambition into results, organizations should cascade **output goals** and **input goals** across functions:

| Function / Team         | Example Goals & Actions |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Sales**               | Integrate Marketplace targets into compensation plans; set quotas for deal size, win rates, and segment-specific deals via Marketplace. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |
| **Operations / Enablement** | Define enablement targets for legal, finance, sales ops; automate private offer workflows; integrate Marketplace metrics into sales ops dashboards. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} |
| **Product / Marketing** | Optimize listings, drive traffic & conversion; build collateral, co-marketing plans; embrace product-led growth mechanisms. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} |
| **Training / Onboarding** | Embed Marketplace education into new hire programs; schedule recurring training sessions for sellers, operations, and cross-functional stakeholders. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} |

By aligning goals at all levels, you transform AWS Marketplace from an afterthought into a key growth engine.

## Implementation Steps & Best Practices

1. **Set a Defined Revenue Goal**  
   Start with a concrete target: a proportion of your total revenue you aim to transact through AWS Marketplace, or a growth rate target for your Marketplace business. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

2. **Drive Organizational Alignment**  
   Hold regular cross-functional working sessions; communicate the strategic importance of Marketplace; ensure all teams understand how they contribute. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

3. **Align Incentives**  
   Ensure your sales compensation plan includes explicit incentives tied to Marketplace sales. This helps motivate behavioral change. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

4. **Monitor, Adjust, Celebrate**  
   Use metrics and dashboards to track performance, identify gaps, pivot where needed, and celebrate wins across teams to maintain momentum. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

## Path Forward & Recommendations

- Begin now—choose a product or use case to pilot in the Marketplace, rather than waiting for perfect timing. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- Use early feedback and data to iterate quickly.  
- Demonstrating real progress helps your leadership team maintain commitment and enables stronger co-sell relationships with AWS.  
- Embed the COSS framework deeply in your operations, not as an afterthought but as a core business approach.

## Conclusion

The AWS Marketplace opportunity is vast—but success requires intentionality. By committing to defined goals, aligning incentives, and applying rigorous practices across teams, partners can transform the Marketplace into a scalable, high-impact growth engine.
