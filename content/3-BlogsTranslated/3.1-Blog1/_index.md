# Enhance Data Visibility with Cribl Search and Amazon Managed Grafana

In today’s digital environment, organizations face challenges in managing the growing volume of operational data across their infrastructure—logs, metrics, and traces from applications and systems.  

This information holds the key to deeper insights and performance improvement. However, to use it effectively, organizations need a **scalable and customizable observability pipeline** that can collect, process, and route data to the right destinations.

## Cribl & Amazon Managed Grafana

* Cribl, an AWS APN partner, provides centralized data management and configurable routing solutions for large volumes of operational and security data.  

* Amazon Managed Grafana is used to visualize data processed by Cribl, turning it into actionable dashboards with real-time insights.  

The integration of Cribl Search with Amazon Managed Grafana enables more powerful monitoring and analysis, helping organizations make faster, more reliable, and large-scale data-driven decisions.

## Key Use Cases

#### 1.  Cloud infrastructure monitoring  
Cribl Search can query data from sources such as Amazon S3, Cribl Lake, Amazon Security Lake, or native AWS services through APIs, without requiring prior indexing. Results can then be sent via Cribl Stream to SIEM systems for analysis.  

Grafana is then used to build real-time dashboards showing resource usage, costs, and performance across AWS regions and related services.  

#### 2.  Application performance management  
Create application-specific dashboards: latency, error rates, user experience, with drill-down capabilities to analyze transactions in detail.  

#### 3.  Security operations  
Display security events via dedicated dashboards, improving incident response time and investigation. Cribl supports continuous monitoring of security events, compliance reporting, and enhanced threat detection.  

---

## Prerequisites

* AWS account with administrative access  
* Amazon S3 bucket (existing or newly created) and VPC Flow Logs with write access to the bucket  
* Proper IAM configuration for users enabling flow logs  
* Cribl Cloud account  

---

## Implementation Steps

#### 1.  Configure API authentication  
Use API tokens to secure communication between Cribl and Amazon Managed Grafana. Access “API Credentials” in the Cribl dashboard to obtain Client ID, secret, etc.  

#### 2.  Install and configure the plugin  
Go to Amazon Managed Grafana > Plugins > “Add new connection” > search for “Cribl” plugin > add connection using Cribl details.  

#### 3.  Create your first visualization  
In Grafana, use the Query tab to run a sample query retrieving VPC Flow Logs from the last 15 minutes, grouped by log status every minute.  

#### 4.  Explore deeper with Table Search in Amazon Managed Grafana  
Switch from time-series chart to table view to see detailed log entries, identify anomalies, and trace requests. For example, query 1,000 records from a dataset to support investigations.

## Cleanup and Cost Considerations

* Delete VPC Flow Logs and temporary S3 buckets when no longer needed.  
* Remove unused Cribl configurations to avoid unnecessary costs.

## Conclusion

The integration of Cribl and Amazon Managed Grafana creates a customizable observability pipeline that centralizes data management, enhances security and compliance, and provides visualized data to support actionable decisions. This solution is valuable for enterprises seeking large-scale observability that is future-ready.
