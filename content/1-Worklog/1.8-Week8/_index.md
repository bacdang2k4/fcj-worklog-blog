### Results Achieved in Week 8:

* Completed the group proposal with clear content, logical structure, and alignment with the project requirements.  
* Reviewed and reinforced knowledge of AWS security design, including IAM, MFA, SCP, Encryption (KMS, TLS/ACM), Security Groups, NACLs, GuardDuty, Shield, WAF, and Secrets Manager.  
* Gained a solid understanding of resilient and highly available architecture design principles, emphasizing the use of Multi-AZ, Multi-Region, DR Strategies, Auto Scaling, Route 53, Load Balancing, and Backup & Restore to enhance system availability and recovery.  
* Strengthened knowledge of high-performance system design, particularly in leveraging EC2 Auto Scaling, Lambda, Fargate, S3, EFS, EBS, Caching, CloudFront, and Global Accelerator to optimize system performance and content delivery.  
* Improved understanding of cost optimization in AWS, including the use of Cost Explorer, Budgets, Savings Plans, Lifecycle Policies, NAT Gateway Optimization, and Storage Tiering.  
* Successfully completed the FCJ midterm assessment, effectively applying the knowledge gained during the week’s review.
