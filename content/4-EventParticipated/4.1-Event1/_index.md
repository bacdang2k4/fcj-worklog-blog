# Sumary report “Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders”

### General Introduction

**Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders** was an event organized by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** with the goal of **connecting engineers, developers, and system architects** in Southern Vietnam.  
The event provided **knowledge, trends, and the latest tools** for building modern cloud-based applications, while creating opportunities for the **builder community** to network, learn, and share practical experiences.

---

### Event Objectives

- Share **best practices** in designing and developing modern applications.  
- Introduce **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** – two advanced application design methodologies.  
- Guide attendees on **choosing the right compute services** to optimize performance and cost.  
- Showcase **Amazon Q Developer** – an AI-powered tool supporting the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  
- Connect the **builder community in Ho Chi Minh City** – for those who could not attend the main session in Hanoi.

---

### List of Speakers

- **Jignesh Shah** – Director, Open Source Databases, AWS  
- **Erica Liu** – Sr. GTM Specialist, App Modernization  
- **Fabrianne Effendi** – Associate Specialist SA, Serverless, AWS  

---

### Key Highlights

#### 1. Challenges of Traditional Application Architectures

- Slow product release cycles → **Missed business opportunities**  
- Inefficient system operations → **Increased costs, reduced productivity**  
- Non-compliance with security regulations → **Loss of credibility and data safety risks**

#### 2. Transition to Microservices Architecture

- Applications are divided into **independent services** communicating through **events**.  
- Three core pillars:
  - **Queue Management** – handle asynchronous tasks  
  - **Caching Strategy** – optimize performance  
  - **Message Handling** – enable flexible service communication

#### 3. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- **Four design steps:** identify domain events → arrange the timeline → identify actors → define bounded contexts  
- **Bookstore case study:** illustrated real-world DDD implementation  
- **Context mapping:** seven patterns for integrating bounded contexts  

#### 4. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

- **Three integration patterns:** Publish/Subscribe, Point-to-Point, Streaming  
- **Benefits:** lower coupling, improved scalability and resilience  
- Comparison of **synchronous vs. asynchronous** – understanding the trade-offs

#### 5. Compute Evolution

- Evolution from **EC2 → ECS → Fargate → Lambda** under the **Shared Responsibility Model**  
- **Serverless benefits:** no server management, auto-scaling, pay-for-value  
- **Functions vs. Containers:** criteria for making the right choice

#### 6. Amazon Q Developer

- **SDLC automation:** streamline the entire lifecycle from planning to maintenance  
- **Code transformation:** upgrade Java, .NET, and modernize applications  
- **AWS Transform Agents:** assist in migration from VMware, Mainframe, and .NET

---

### Key Learnings

#### Design Mindset

- **Business-first approach:** always start from business needs, not technology  
- **Ubiquitous language:** build a shared vocabulary between business and technical teams  
- **Bounded contexts:** divide complex systems into manageable parts

#### Technical Architecture

- Apply **Event Storming** to model business processes  
- Use **event-driven communication** instead of synchronous calls  
- Understand **integration patterns:** sync, async, pub/sub, streaming  
- Know how to select from the **compute spectrum:** VM → container → serverless

#### Modernization Strategy

- **Phased approach:** modernize in stages with a clear roadmap  
- **7Rs framework:** select the right strategy for each application  
- **ROI measurement:** evaluate effectiveness through cost and agility metrics

---

### Application in Work

- Apply **DDD** to current projects through event storming sessions with business teams  
- **Refactor microservices** using bounded contexts  
- **Implement event-driven patterns:** replace synchronous calls with async messaging  
- **Pilot serverless** using AWS Lambda for suitable use cases  
- **Integrate Amazon Q Developer** into the workflow to enhance productivity

---

### Experience at the Event

#### Workshop “GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization”

- Provided a comprehensive view on **modernizing applications and databases** using AI and modern architectural practices.  

#### Learning from Experts

- AWS speakers shared **best practices** in modern application design.  
- Through **real-world case studies**, I gained deeper insights into applying DDD and EDA to large-scale systems.

#### Hands-on Technical Experience

- Practiced **event storming** to model business processes.  
- Learned how to **split microservices** and define bounded contexts.  
- Understood **trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication**.

#### Using Modern Tools

- Hands-on experience with **Amazon Q Developer**, an AI tool supporting SDLC from planning to maintenance.  
- Learned how to **automate code transformation** and experiment with **AWS Lambda** in practice.

#### Community Networking

- Opportunities to **connect with experts, peers, and business teams**.  
- Realized the importance of a **business-first approach** and **ubiquitous language** across departments.

#### Key Takeaways

- Applying DDD and EDA helps **reduce coupling** and increase **scalability** and **resilience**.  
- System modernization requires a **clear roadmap** and measurable **ROI**.  
- AI tools like **Amazon Q Developer** can **boost productivity** when integrated properly.
